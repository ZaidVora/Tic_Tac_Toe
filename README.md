# Tic_Tac_Toe

My first mini project in python langauge. This is basically a game where two player can play together. Here system will ask both player their input and one player will win, if it will clear all its criteria. 

About logic of game:
Different kinds of functions are created according to needs of game such as player input, winnning criteria, player turn , display input and output. After that, mergeing all the function logic in an systematic order and then, game is created.
